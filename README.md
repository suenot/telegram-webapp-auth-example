# Telegram WebApp Secure Authentication Example

This project demonstrates how to securely authenticate a Telegram user in a web application launched from a Telegram bot using the `WebAppInitData` mechanism.

It uses:
*   `pyTelegramBotAPI` for the Telegram bot.
*   `Flask` for the simple web application backend.
*   `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables.
*   Standard Python libraries (`hmac`, `hashlib`, `json`, `urllib`) for validation.

## How it Works

1.  **User Interaction:** The user sends `/start` or `/login` to the Telegram bot.
2.  **Bot Response:** The bot replies with a message containing an inline button configured with a `WebAppInfo` URL pointing to our web application.
3.  **WebApp Launch:** The user clicks the button. Telegram opens the specified URL in an in-app browser and passes cryptographically signed `initData` containing user information.
4.  **Frontend (`index.html`):** The web page loads, uses the `telegram-web-app.js` library to access `window.Telegram.WebApp.initData`, and sends this data to the backend `/validate` endpoint.
5.  **Backend (`app.py`):** The Flask application receives the `initData` at the `/validate` endpoint. It performs HMAC-SHA256 validation using the secret `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to ensure the data is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.
6.  **Authentication Result:** If validation succeeds, the backend responds with success and the parsed user information. The frontend displays this result. If validation fails, a 403 Forbidden error is returned.

```

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files as provided).**

2.  **Create a Telegram Bot:**
    *   Talk to `@BotFather` on Telegram.
    *   Create a new bot using `/newbot`.
    *   Note down the **HTTP API token** provided by BotFather.

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory (where `bot.py` is).
    *   Add the following lines to `.env`, replacing the placeholders:
        ```dotenv
        TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" 
        # Example using ngrok for local testing:
        WEBAPP_URL="https://your-unique-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok-free.app"
        ```
    *   **Important:** The `WEBAPP_URL` must be HTTPS.

4.  **Expose Your Web App (for Local Development):**
    *   Since the Telegram client needs to access your web app via HTTPS, you'll need a tool like `ngrok` if running locally.
    *   Install ngrok: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)
    *   Run ngrok to expose the port your Flask app will run on (default is 5001 in `webapp/app.py`):
        ```bash
        ngrok http 5001
        ```
    *   Ngrok will give you an HTTPS forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abcdef123456.ngrok-free.app`). Use this URL as your `WEBAPP_URL` in the `.env` file.

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Example

1.  **Start the Web Application:**
    *   Navigate to the `webapp` directory:
        ```bash
        cd webapp
        ```
    *   Run the Flask app:
        ```bash
        python app.py 
        ```
    *   Keep this terminal running.

2.  **Start the Telegram Bot:**
    *   Open a *new* terminal.
    *   Navigate back to the project root directory (if you changed directory):
        ```bash
        cd ..
        ```
    *   Run the bot script:
        ```bash
        python bot.py
        ```
    *   Keep this terminal running.

3.  **Test in Telegram:**
    *   Open Telegram and find the bot you created.
    *   Send the `/start` command.
    *   Click the "Open Web App üîê" button.
    *   The web app should open inside Telegram, attempt validation, and show either a success message with your user info or an error message.

## Next Steps

Once the user is authenticated, you can use the validated `user_info` (especially the `id`) in your `webapp/app.py` backend to:

*   **Create a Session:** Use Flask's session management (or another method like JWT) to keep the user logged in for subsequent requests to your web app within that session.
*   **User Database:** Look up the Telegram user ID in your application's database. If the user exists, log them in. If not, you might prompt them to complete a registration process, linking their Telegram ID to a new or existing account in your system.
*   **Personalization:** Use the user's first name, last name, or language code (if available in `user_info`) to personalize the web app experience.
*   **API Calls:** Store the user's ID to associate actions they take within the web app (like saving data) with their identity.

Remember to handle potential errors, such as when `user_info` might be missing or incomplete even if the hash validation passed.

## Security Note: Verifying Data Authenticity with HMAC

The security of the Telegram Web App authentication hinges on verifying that the `initData` string received by your backend genuinely originates from Telegram and hasn't been tampered with. This verification uses a **Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)**, specifically HMAC-SHA256.

Here's a breakdown of how this process confirms the data's origin and integrity:

1.  **The Shared Secret:** The foundation of this security model is your **`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`**. This token is known *only* to you (your backend server) and Telegram. It must be kept absolutely confidential.

2.  **Data Signing by Telegram:** When a user launches your Web App, Telegram prepares the `initData` string. Before sending it, Telegram performs these steps:
    *   It collects all the key-value pairs intended for `initData`, *except* for the `hash` itself.
    *   It sorts these pairs alphabetically by key (e.g., `auth_date=...`, `query_id=...`, `user=...`).
    *   It formats them into a single string with each pair on a new line (`key=value\nkey=value...`). Let's call this the `data-check-string`.
    *   It derives a secret key specifically for this validation using HMAC: `secret_key = HMAC_SHA256("WebAppData", TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN)`.
    *   It calculates the final signature (the `hash`) by applying HMAC-SHA256 again using the derived `secret_key` and the `data-check-string`: `generated_hash = HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, data-check-string)`.
    *   Telegram attaches this `generated_hash` to the `initData` under the `hash` key and sends the complete `initData` string to the user's client, which then forwards it to your backend.

3.  **Server-Side Verification (Your Backend):** When your `/validate` endpoint receives the `initData`, it must perform the *exact same steps* to recalculate the hash:
    *   **Parse `initData`:** Extract the received `hash` and all other key-value pairs.
    *   **Reconstruct `data-check-string`:** Remove the received `hash` pair, sort the remaining pairs alphabetically by key, and join them with newline characters, precisely matching Telegram's format.
    *   **Derive `secret_key`:** Use *your* stored `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (the shared secret) to calculate the exact same secret key: `secret_key = HMAC_SHA256("WebAppData", YOUR_BOT_TOKEN)`.
    *   **Calculate Expected Hash:** Calculate the hash using the derived `secret_key` and the reconstructed `data-check-string`: `expected_hash = HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, reconstructed_data_check_string)`.
    *   **Compare Hashes:** Critically compare the `expected_hash` your server just calculated with the `hash` received within the `initData`.

4.  **The Verdict:**
    *   **Match:** If `expected_hash == received_hash`, it cryptographically proves:
        *   **Authenticity:** The data *must* have originated from Telegram for *your specific bot*. Only Telegram, knowing the correct `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, could compute the correct `secret_key` needed to generate the valid `hash` for that specific `data-check-string`. An attacker without the token cannot forge this.
        *   **Integrity:** The data has not been altered since Telegram signed it. Any modification to the user data, `auth_date`, or other fields would change the `data-check-string`, resulting in a different `expected_hash` that would *not* match the `received_hash`.
    *   **Mismatch:** If the hashes do not match, the data is considered invalid ‚Äì either it didn't come from Telegram, or it was tampered with, or your validation logic (e.g., string formatting) is incorrect. Your server should reject the request (e.g., return a 403 Forbidden status).

5.  **Timestamp Check (Replay Prevention):** While HMAC confirms authenticity and integrity *at the time of signing*, it doesn't prevent an attacker from replaying an old, valid `initData` string. Therefore, your backend should also check the `auth_date` field (a Unix timestamp) within the validated data. Ensure this timestamp is reasonably recent (e.g., within a few minutes or hours, depending on your application's tolerance) to mitigate replay attacks. This example includes a check for freshness within one day in `validate_init_data` in `webapp/app.py`.

**In Summary:** The security relies on the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm and the confidentiality of your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. By successfully recalculating the same hash that Telegram generated, your server verifies that the data is authentic (from Telegram), unmodified, and associated with your specific bot.

        end
    else Hashes Mismatch
        BE-->>FE: 403 Forbidden (status: 'error', message: 'Invalid hash')
    end
```

## Next Steps

Once the user is authenticated, you can use the validated `user_info` (especially the `id`) in your `webapp/app.py` backend to:

*   **Create a Session:** Use Flask's session management (or another method like JWT) to keep the user logged in for subsequent requests to your web app within that session.
*   **User Database:** Look up the Telegram user ID in your application's database. If the user exists, log them in. If not, you might prompt them to complete a registration process, linking their Telegram ID to a new or existing account in your system.
*   **Personalization:** Use the user's first name, last name, or language code (if available in `user_info`) to personalize the web app experience.
*   **API Calls:** Store the user's ID to associate actions they take within the web app (like saving data) with their identity.

Remember to handle potential errors, such as when `user_info` might be missing or incomplete even if the hash validation passed.

## Security Note

The security of the Telegram Web App authentication relies on the `hash` field provided within the `initData` string and the secrecy of your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. Here's a breakdown of why it's secure:

1.  **Data Signing:** When the Web App is launched, Telegram generates a unique `hash` string. This hash is created by:
    *   Collecting all other data fields from `initData` (like `user`, `auth_date`, etc.).
    *   Sorting these fields alphabetically by key.
    *   Formatting them into a specific string format (e.g., `key1=value1
key2=value2...`).
    *   Calculating an HMAC-SHA256 signature of this string using a secret key derived from your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.

2.  **Server-Side Verification:** Your backend server (`webapp/app.py` in this example) receives the `initData` string including the `hash`. To verify its authenticity, the server must:
    *   **Keep the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` absolutely secret.** It should never be exposed client-side or in public repositories.
    *   Reconstruct the data string exactly as Telegram did (by removing the `hash` field, sorting the remaining key-value pairs, and joining them with newline characters).
    *   Derive the same secret key from the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` using HMAC (`HMAC(bot_token, "WebAppData")`).
    *   Calculate its own expected HMAC-SHA256 hash using the derived secret key and the reconstructed data string.
    *   **Compare** the `hash` received from the client with the hash calculated on the server.

3.  **Integrity and Authenticity:**
    *   If the hashes match, it proves two things:
        *   **Authenticity:** The data genuinely originated from Telegram for *your specific bot* because only Telegram and your server (which knows the secret `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) could generate the correct hash.
        *   **Integrity:** The data has not been tampered with since it was generated by Telegram. Any modification to the data fields would result in a different reconstructed string and thus a mismatched hash.

4.  **Timestamp Check (Optional but Recommended):** The `auth_date` field (a Unix timestamp) included in `initData` should be checked on the server to ensure the validation request is recent, preventing potential replay attacks where an old, intercepted `initData` string might be reused. This example includes a check for freshness (`validate_init_data` in `webapp/app.py`).

**In summary:** The cryptographic signature (HMAC-SHA256 hash) ensures that the user data received by your web application backend is authentic and unmodified, provided your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` remains confidential.
